A simple script I created to practice working with Python's OS module.

The goal is to automate the process of re-naming a file.  While this task is not difficulty using the GUI of an operating system, it is a common task in many professions and can get annoying.

Once some additional error handling has been implemented, I plan to extend this to be able to handle bulk editing of file names.
